        <p>Things I'm proud of and how I stay humble</p>
        <p>I've overcome many things in my life...</p>
        <p>...been in the ashes but I have risen up to the challenge.</p>
        <p>I'm proud of myself for rising above all of my fears and conquering my emotions.</p>
        <p>I've survived poverty and starvation and homelessness and abuse and trauma.</p>
        <p>But my mind is clear of what is real and what is not. Keeping a clear goal has always helped - meditation, music, and knowing who I am and rediscovering myself over and over with every new challenge.</p>
        <p>I'm proud of discovering the meaning of life for myself multiple times, every time going deeper in my mind, being just with people, honest and honorable. I'm proud of trying to make Earth a better place, recycling, not buying from evil companies, and doing my part in this generation.</p>
        <p>...And how I stay humble?...</p>
        <p>I remember I'm still a 3-dimensional being, physically bound to this mortal world. I'm trying to walk my path without hurting anyone but also keeping healthy boundaries. Being mindful of this whole world and how things actually operate keeps my ego in check. I'm just a human.</p>
